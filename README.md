## AI Coding Skills

AI coding skills that enhance developer productivity on Solana.

- [solana-dev-skill](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-dev-skill) - End-to-end Solana development skill for Claude Code. Covers wallet connections, Anchor/Pinocchio programs, client generation, testing with LiteSVM/Mollusk, and security best practices.

- [solana-anchor-claude-skill](https://github.com/mikemaccana/solana-anchor-claude-skill) - end to end Solana development for Anchor and Solana Kit, focusing on modern, minimal, readable code. Testing is with native JS test runners or LiteSVM.

- [solana-skills-plugin](https://github.com/tenequm/claude-plugins/tree/main/solana) - Solana skills for Claude Code: program development with Anchor/native Rust (testing and deployment included), security auditing with vulnerability detection and audit report generation, and ZK compression for rent-free tokens/PDAs via Light Protocol.

- [magicblock-dev-skill](https://github.com/magicblock-labs/magicblock-dev-skill) - End-to-end MagicBlock development skill for Claude Code. [MagicBlock](https://magicblock.xyz) is a Solana network extension designed to help programs with latency/privacy needs, along with other native tools like VRFs, Cranks, Session Keys and more.

## AI Agents

AI agents and autonomous systems built for Solana.

- [Chronoeffector AI Arena](https://arena.chronoeffector.ai) - Chronoeffector AI is a decentralized platform building a fully autonomous AI agent trading arena on Solana, enabling users to deploy AI agents for trading cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, and prediction markets.
- [Solana Agent Kit](https://github.com/sendaifun/solana-agent-kit) - Open-source toolkit connecting AI agents to 30+ Solana protocols with 50+ actions including token operations, NFTs, and swaps. Compatible with Eliza, LangChain, and Vercel AI SDK.
- [Eliza Framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) - Lightweight TypeScript AI agent framework with Solana integrations, Twitter/X bots, and character-based configuration for agent behaviors.
- [GOAT Framework](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat) - Open-source toolkit for connecting AI agents to 200+ onchain tools with multi-chain support including Solana, EVM, and more.
- [AgenC](https://github.com/tetsuo-ai/AgenC) - Privacy-focused multi-agent coordination framework with ZK proof integrations and confidential compute for Solana.
## Developer Tools

AI-enhanced development tools for the Solana ecosystem.

- [SLO (Solana LLM Oracle)](https://github.com/GauravBurande/solana-llm-oracle) - Enables LLM inference directly in Solana programs for on-chain AI capabilities in games and protocols requiring autonomous functions.
- [LumoKit](https://github.com/Lumo-Labs-AI/lumokit) - Lightweight Python AI toolkit for Solana with on-chain actions, token swaps via Jupiter, and research capabilities for ecosystem developers.
- [SATI (Solana Agent Trust Infrastructure)](https://github.com/cascade-protocol/sati) - ERC-8004 compliant agent identity and reputation with proof-of-participation: agents sign before knowing feedback outcomes.
